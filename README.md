# Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Benji Tusk. I'm in my third year at the Jerusalem College of Technology, studying Computer Science. I'm also a founder and the lead frontend developer for ScheduLearn, a schedule solver for schools.

I'm keeping myself busy with a handful of projects at the moment, such as
- Frontend Development for ScheduLearn
- Publishing and updating all of my CS notes to my website
- Finishing an Android app for a school I previously attended
- Personal development (way harder than frontend dev, tbh)

I like to stay active when I'm outside, rollerblading or taking walks, and I also like to stay active when I'm inside, on GitHub:
