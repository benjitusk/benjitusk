# Hi there, and welcome to my GitHub Page! ðŸ‘‹
I have an interesting habit of writing my README.md's in a Q&A format, so I'm going to switch to 2nd person for the questions, but answer them in 1st person.
## Who are you?
My name is Benji Tusk. I am a student, currently studying abroad in a gap year program.
## What are your current projects?
I have my hands full right now with multiple projects, including:
- An app for the school I'm studying in
- A WhatsApp bot for keeping the students in my school updated on the food schedule
## What is your college plan?
I am planning on going to the Jerusalem College of Technology, starting in October 2022.

## Are you active on GitHub?
